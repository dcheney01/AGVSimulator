# AGVSimulator

This project shows a simulated 2D vehicle in an environment with static obstacles, utilizing A* for path planning and a PD controller for path following. The goal of the robot is to navigate through the environment without any collisions with the obstacles. This project is programmed in C++ using Qt for the GUI. The project is thoroughly unit tested using GTest and built using CMake.
